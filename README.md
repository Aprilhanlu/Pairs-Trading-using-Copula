# Pairs-Trading-using-Copula
## Introdution
This project is to apply Copula Function to pair trading strategy in American stock market. 
##### Copula
In statistics, a copula function is a multivariate probability distribution for which the marginal probability distribution of each variable is uniform. Copulas are used to describe the dependence between random variables.
##### Pairs Trading
The objective of pairs trading is to identify the relative overvalued and undervalued positions between two stocks that are closely related, with a long-run relationship. 

Such relative mispricing occurs if the spread between the two stocks deviates from its equilibrium, and excess returns will be generated if the pair is mean-reverting (that is, any deviations are temporary, and will return to its equilibrium after a period of adjustment). In this situation, the strategy will simultaneously short the relatively overvalued stock and long the relatively undervalued.
